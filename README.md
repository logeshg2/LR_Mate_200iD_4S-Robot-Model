# LR_Mate_200iD_4S-Robot-Model

This Repo contains the Fanuc robot model in Robotic Toolbox using Python and MatLab. The repo contains some additional functions to work with the developed fanuc model.
The Robot model (Python + Matlab), pick and place example, handeye calibration, and LR Mate 200iD 4s control with PLC and python can be found in this repo.

The work, demo video and documentation is still in progress. So stay tunned... **[WIP]**
